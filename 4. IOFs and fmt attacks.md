Now, stack attacks are fun and all, but those aren't all the things you can do to make programs do funny things!
## Integer Overflow (IOF)
Computers represent numbers via `1` and `0`. But how to they represent Negative numbers?

You might have heard of one or [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). And that's your answer!

| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | Number |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |    1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   -1   |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |    9   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   -9   |

The above table shows some 8-bit signed integers, and their binary representations.

> [!NOTE]
> `7` is the most significan bit(MSB) and hence is the sign bit of the number! This becomes important later

### Arithmetic Operators
We all know about `+-*/`(add, subtract, multiply, and divide). <!-- That being good albums -->
However, they can sometimes be dangerous when working with signed values (of fixed widths) due to IOFs.

For example, in an 8-bit integer: $100 + 100 = -56$

| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | Num |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -56 |

Basically, the added bits gets carried over to the sign bit that changes it to `1`, making the entire value negative! \
Some programs might not properly check the results of certain values and be vulnerable to IOF attacks.

## Format String Vulnerability
Format String vulnerabilities arise when user input is used as the format argument in `printf`, `scanf`, or it's family of functions. This has varying consequences, including arbitrary reading and/or writing of values.

### Concept
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char stack_string[] = "I am a stack string!";
    char input[11];
    input[10] = '\x00';
    scanf("%10s", input);
    printf(input);
    printf("Also, %s\n", stack_string);
    return 0;
}
```

The above code is an example of a format string vulnerability. While `scanf` only allows us to write `10` characters(hence preventing a [buffer overflow](3.%20Stack%20Smashing.md)), `printf` uses `input` as it's format argument.

```sh
└─$ ./fmtstr
hello!
hello!Also, I am a stack string!
```
If we pass it any input, it simply prints it out and exits. However, what happens if we pass `%s`?

```sh
└─$ ./fmtstr
%s
Segmentation fault
```
We get a segfault and the program exits!
This happens due to `printf` trying to access invalid memory that isnt allocated to the process.

### Calling conventions
Lets take a short break from format strings and talk abit about calling conventions. in `x86-64`, the first few params are loaded into registers, then after that, it gets **put on the stack**. This means we can read(and modify) stack variables!

### Accessing specific values
While it's fun to spam `%x%x%x` in the program, we are limited in what we might be able to print(as we are only given 10 characters). We can overcome this with some `printf` magic. \
`printf` has a format string that allows you to specify which **parameter** you are using, being: `%n$x`(where `n` is the parameter and `x` is the format specifier). For example, if I want to print a string pointer at the param 8, it'll be `%8$s`.

Now, lets try leaking the stack string(or at least part of it!) from the stack!
```
└─$ ./fmtstr
%8$x%9$x
6d6120496b636174Also, I am a stack string!
```
`6d6120496b636174A` becomes "ma Ikcat" which translates into "I am" and "tack" from "stack". We can hence read values from the stack!

### Writing values
> [!NOTE]
> Code such as `printf(foo);` often indicates a bug, since foo may contain a % character. If foo comes from untrusted user input, it may contain %n, causing the printf() call to write to memory and creating a security hole.

The above was taken from the `man` for `printf`, under BUGS.

#### What does this mean?
`%n` writes a value into a parameter.
```c
int characters_printed;
prinf("Hello, world!\n%n", &characters_printed);
```
In the above example, `characters_printed` = 13 at the end of the program. If we are able to control the amount of characters printed before `%n`, we can write any value we want!

**This is a very useful and powerful format string to abuse. We can overwrite stack variables, pointers, and even the instruction pointer without affecting values around them!**

### Format specifiers
The entire list of format specifiers is extremely exhaustive. You can refer to the command `man 3 printf` for the full list or an online manual.: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html

Some of the more noteworthy formats are listed below

| Format | Explaination | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `%x` | Prints values in hex | `%x` |
| `%d` | Prints values in decimal | `%d` |
| `%s` | Prints value at the address specified(until NULL) | `%s` |
| `%X$Y`| Access param number `X`, with `Y` format | `%10$d` |
| `%XY` | Print a minimum of `X` values, of `Y` format | `%100x` |
| `%n` | Writes total amount of printed characters so far in current call. | `%100x%n` |

### Other Pitfalls
There are plenty other pitfalls that can be talked about, way too much out of scope for this document.

CTF101 has challenges that test these two vulnerabilities, good luck and have fun!
