# CTF101 - Binary Exploitation (1)

## Pwning
Before continuing, I'd highly recommend reading the [Getting Started](./README.md) guide, as it covers the basics of setting up your environment and the tools you'll need for binary exploitation.

Verify that you have the following (version doesn't matter too much, for now):

If you intend to use [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg), initialize it however you'd like but make sure you can load into this screen:

### Sockets & Connections
In binary exploitation, we often need to interact with a remote server to exploit a vulnerability. This is done through a socket connection, which is a way to communicate between two processes over a network.

You can check this out yourself using `nc` (netcat), which is a utility that reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.

On a terminal, run the following command:
```bash
nc -lnvp 1337
```

This command will start a netcat listener on port 1337, waiting for a connection. You can now connect to this listener using another terminal window:
```bash
nc localhost 1337
```

![nc](https://i.gyazo.com/30c185275786f7da77c8c19632871173.png)

You can now type messages in the terminal that started the listener, and they will appear in the terminal that connected to it.

The basis of binary exploitation is to craft malicious payloads that will be sent, and parsed by the remote server. The vulnerability usually lies in **how** the payload is parsed, and **where** the payload is stored in memory, and **when** the payload is ever referenced.

### Pwning Challenges
In the context of CTFs, binaries are usually listening on a port and will interact with you over a socket connection. 

Let's take `infant pwn` from [CTF101](https://ctf.gryphons.sg/) as an example.

Omitting the "vulnerability" in the source code, here's what the program looks like:

```c
void lose() {
    printf( "Sorry, try again\n" );
    exit( 1 );
}

void vuln() {
    int  canary = 0xdeadbeef;
    char overflow_me[100];

    printf( "[-] canary set to: %p\n", canary );
    printf( "overflow me plz: " );

    gets( overflow_me );

    printf( "value of canary now: %p\n", canary );
    if ( canary != 0xdeadbeef ) {
        win();
    } else {
        lose();
    }
}

int main( int argc, char ** argv ) {

    setbuf( stdin, 0 );
    setbuf( stdout, 0 );

    vuln();

    return 0;
}
```

Let's ignore the vulnerability for now, and run the binary that the challenge provides us.
* the binary is located in `infant_pwn.zip` in: `\service\infant_pwn\vuln`
* if the binary is not already set to executable, set it with: `chmod +x vuln`

If nothing went wrong, this is what you should see:

In the challenge description, we're given a netcat one-liner to connect to this challenge remotely as well: `nc chal1.gryphons.sg 10004`

As expected, the challenge appears to be working as intended; feel free to play around with the binary and see what you can do with it!

We'll walk through the exploitation of this challenge in the next guide(s), [Setting Up](./2.%20Setting%20Up.md) and [Stack Smashing](./3.%20Stack%20Smashing.md).
