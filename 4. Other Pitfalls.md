# CTF101 - Binary Exploitation (3)

Now, stack attacks are fun and all, but those aren't all the things you can do to make programs do funny things!
## Integer Overflow (IOF)
Computers represent numbers via `1` and `0`. But how to they represent Negative numbers?

You might have heard of one or [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). And that's your answer!

| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | Number |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |    1   |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   -1   |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |    9   |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   -9   |

The above table shows some 8-bit signed integers, and their binary representations.

> [!NOTE]
> `7` is the most significan bit(MSB) and hence is the sign bit of the number! This becomes important later

### Arithmetic Operators
We all know about `+-*/`(add, subtract, multiply, and divide). <!-- That being good albums -->
However, they can sometimes be dangerous when working with signed values (of fixed widths) due to IOFs.

For example, in an 8-bit integer: $100 + 100 = -56$

| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | Num |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -56 |

Basically, the added bits gets carried over to the sign bit that changes it to `1`, making the entire value negative! \
Some programs might not properly check the results of certain values and be vulnerable to IOF attacks.
