# CTF101 - Binary Exploitation (2)
> author: [@gatari](https://github.com/gatariee) & [@duckupus](https://github.com/duckupus)

_continuation of the infant pwn challenge from [CTF101](https://ctf.gryphons.sg/)_

## Best Practice
Let's take a step back and look at what the author gave us in the challenge.

* `infant_pwn.zip`
    * `service`
        * `docker-compose.yml`
        * `run.sh`
        * `infant_pwn`
            * `flag`
            * `vuln`
            * `Dockerfile`
    * `vuln.c`

This might seem like a lot, but it's actually quite simple. The `service` folder essentially contains everything you need to run the challenge locally, and it is an exact replica of the service running on the CTF server.

`docker-compose.yml` is a file that defines the services, networks, and volumes for the challenge. It's a simple file that tells Docker how to run the challenge.

`run.sh` is a simple script that runs the Docker container, and it's a good idea to look at it to see how the challenge is run.
```sh
#!/bin/sh
docker compose up --build
```

`infant_pwn` is the folder that contains the challenge. It contains the binary `vuln`, the flag, and the Dockerfile, the goal is to retrieve the `flag` remotely by exploiting the binary (`vuln`).

## Running the Challenge
Q: So, how do we run the challenge? 

A: Just run the `run.sh` script, you'll probably need to run this as root, so use `sudo` if you're not already root.

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
sudo ./run.sh
```

![run.sh](https://i.gyazo.com/1fe85d2e505ee724964cbdb922317ee7.png)

If everything went well, you should see the following output after a couple minutes:

![build](https://i.gyazo.com/aba4913f5a9592d7327ad40d0668cf9a.png)

The line: `infant_pwn  | [I][2024-05-03T03:00:55+0000] Listening on [::]:5000` tells us that the challenge is running locally on port `5000`.

Instead of running: `nc chal1.gryphons.sg 10004` to hit the server remotely, we can test our exploit locally by running: `nc localhost 5000`.

If our exploit works locally, then we can run it and get the flag remotely on the server!

## Author's Note
Before running your solve script remotely, make sure to test it locally in **two** ways first:
1. On the binary itself
    * `./vuln`
2. In the Docker container
    * `nc localhost 5000`

I'd recommend solving it on the local binary first (attaching a debugger is _much_ easier) and then running it on the Docker container to see if it works.

If it works in the Docker container, it should work on the server as well.
